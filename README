get ready to walk on Python developer legs in the grounds of Gogle AppEngine

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

it's a small project for python developers to use Google AppEngine... not as spoon-feeder as Rails but would enable you to quickly walk on your Legs in the feature rich ground of GAE

it's just an initial release... slowly more web productivity and all the features from GAE will get added to it

CURRENTLY: I'm building a stable & required structure for all web features... once it's done, I'll proceed with Automated Generator Scripts.
Right now, it's mid-way 'mvc' structure.
